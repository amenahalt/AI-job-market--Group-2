## Problem Definition
- AI is reshaping jobs globally
- Jobs disappearing, new ones emerging
- Skills shifting in tech, marketing, retail
- HR and policymakers need clarity


## Research Objectives
- RO1: AI adoption vs. job growth/decline
- RO2: Job roles most impacted by AI
- RO3: Skills needed in AI-driven jobs
- Focus: Industries, locations, remote work

## Importance of the Topic
- HR: Hire/train for changing roles
- Business owners: Stay competitive
- Policymakers: Update education
- Example: More design skills for remote jobs?

##  Sampling/Data Collection
- Source: Kaggle "AI-Powered Job Market Insights"
- Data: Job location, AI use, salary, remote, growth
- Why: Pre-collected, sufficient for class project
- No manual collection needed

## Data Wrangling – From Records to Data
- Load CSV from Kaggle (Excel or Python)
- Check columns: Job titles, AI adoption, growth
- Look for weird stuff (missing data)
- Decide how to handle issues

## Data Wrangling – Tidying the Data
- Standardize job titles (e.g., UX/UI vs. UI/UX)
- Handle missing data (skip rows if few)
- Goal: Neat, consistent dataset

## Data Wrangling – Transforming the Data
- Convert AI adoption: "low" = 1, "medium" = 2, "high" = 3
- Group jobs (e.g., tech vs. retail)
- Make data ready for analysis


## RO1 - AI Adoption & Jobs
- IV: Level of AI adoption
- DV: Job growth or decline
- Plan:
  - Clean data, encode variables
  - Visualize: Bar charts, boxplots, scatter plots

## RO2 - Job Roles Impacted
- IV: Job title (e.g., UX/UI, marketing)
- DV: Growth projection
- Plan:
  - Collect job data (R, tidyverse)
  - Visualize: ggplots for growth/salary

##  RO3 - Skills in AI Jobs
- IV: Job title
- DV: Required skills
- Factors: Remote, industry, salary
- Plan:
  - Group by skills
  - Pie charts: Skills by remote/in-person

## Conclusion
- AI reshapes jobs and skills
- Insights for HR, businesses, policymakers
- Goal: Prepare workforce for AI economy
- Clean data is key to trends
